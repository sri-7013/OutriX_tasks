# LinkShield - Phishing URL Detection

## ✅ Task Title: LINKSHIELD
Phishing URL Detection Using Rule-Based System

## 👨‍💻 Intern Details:
- **Name:** Srikar Gundoji
- **Domain:** Cybersecurity
- **Internship:** OutriX Virtual Internship

## 🧠 What I Did:
I developed a Python GUI tool named **LinkShield** that detects whether a given URL is legitimate or phishing.  
The detection system is rule-based and analyzes multiple aspects of the URL such as:
- Suspicious characters (`@`, `-`)
- URL length and number of dots
- SSL Certificate status
- WHOIS domain info

The GUI is built using **CustomTkinter**, and it integrates `socket`, `ssl`, and other networking libraries.

## 🔧 Tools & Technologies Used:
- Python
- CustomTkinter
- Regex
- `socket`, `ssl`, `whois`
- `urllib.parse`

## 💡 Learning Outcome:
- Understood how phishing websites fool users with malicious URLs.
- Built a rule-based engine to classify URLs using logic and pattern matching.
- Learned to use SSL, WHOIS, and URL parsing in real-world applications.
- Gained hands-on experience in GUI building and cybersecurity concepts.
